# A Magical Journey Through A Procedurally Generated Forest

## About
This project takes the user through a procedurally generated world using C++ and OpenGL 3.0. The goal is to show our knowledge on using shaders and buffering data through the graphics pipeline. By procedurally generating the world, no two scenes are exactly the same.

## Build Environment
The project was built using Visual Studio 2015 in C++ with OpenGL 3.0. All necessary dependencies and libraries are included within the project in their respective folders.

## Controls
The following controls work by holding onto the keys.

'W': Move Camera forward

'A': Move Camera to the left

'S': Move Camera downward

'D': Move Camera to the right

'SPACE': Ascend the camera 

'Left Control': Descend the camera 

'Left Shift': Doubles camera movement speed

'C': Slow down camera movement speed by half
